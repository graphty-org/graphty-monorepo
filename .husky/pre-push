# Compare against origin/master to detect changes since last push
# This works for both:
# - Direct commits on master (compares to what's already pushed)
# - Feature branches (compares to upstream master)
# Build first to ensure type dependencies are available for linting
pnpm exec nx affected -t build lint test --base=origin/master --head=HEAD --parallel=3
