# Pre-push validation is handled by CI (GitHub Actions)
#
# Why we removed local pre-push checks:
# 1. nx affected has known issues in git hook contexts (GIT_DIR conflicts)
# 2. NX daemon/plugin workers cause terminal hangs
# 3. CI already runs comprehensive lint, build, and test on every push
#
# For manual pre-push validation, run: pnpm run prepush
# To skip this hook entirely: git push --no-verify
#
