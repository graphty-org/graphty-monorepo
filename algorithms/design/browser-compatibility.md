# Browser Compatibility Guide

The @graphty/algorithms library is designed to work in both Node.js and browser environments. This guide explains how the library handles platform differences.

## Environment Detection

The library automatically detects the runtime environment and adjusts behavior accordingly:

```javascript
import { isNodeEnvironment, isBrowserEnvironment } from "@graphty/algorithms";

if (isNodeEnvironment()) {
    // Node.js specific code
} else if (isBrowserEnvironment()) {
    // Browser specific code
}
```

## Configuration

### Node.js

Use environment variables:

```bash
export GRAPHTY_USE_OPTIMIZED_BFS=true
export GRAPHTY_BFS_ALPHA=15.0
node your-script.js
```

### Browser

Configure before loading the library:

```html
<script>
    window.__GRAPHTY_CONFIG__ = {
        GRAPHTY_USE_OPTIMIZED_BFS: "true",
        GRAPHTY_BFS_ALPHA: "15.0",
    };
</script>
<script type="module">
    import { Graph, betweennessCentrality } from "./graphty-algorithms.js";
    // Your code here
</script>
```

## Bundle Usage

For browser environments, use the bundled version:

```html
<!-- ES Module -->
<script type="module">
    import * as graphty from "https://unpkg.com/@graphty/algorithms/dist/algorithms.js";
</script>

<!-- Or with a bundler -->
<script src="your-bundled-app.js"></script>
```

## Performance Considerations

### Browser Optimizations

- Automatic detection of large graphs
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Progressive computation with Web Workers (planned)

### Node.js Optimizations

- Full access to system memory
- Native BigInt support
- Process-based parallelization (planned)

## API Differences

All APIs work identically in both environments. The only differences are:

1. **Configuration**: Environment variables (Node.js) vs window config (Browser)
2. **Memory limits**: Browsers have stricter memory constraints
3. **File I/O**: Not available in browsers (use fetch for remote data)

## Example: Cross-Platform Code

```javascript
import { Graph, betweennessCentrality, configureGlobalOptimizations, getEnvVar } from "@graphty/algorithms";

// Works in both environments
async function runAnalysis() {
    // Check for configuration
    const useOptimized = getEnvVar("GRAPHTY_USE_OPTIMIZED_BFS") === "true";

    // Configure if needed
    if (useOptimized) {
        await configureGlobalOptimizations("performance");
    }

    // Create and analyze graph
    const graph = new Graph();
    // ... add nodes and edges ...

    const centrality = betweennessCentrality(graph, {
        optimized: true,
        normalized: true,
    });

    return centrality;
}
```

## Testing

The library is tested in both environments:

- Node.js: Full test suite with Vitest
- Browser: Browser-specific tests via Playwright

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"process is not defined"** - This should not happen with the latest version. If it does, ensure you're using the bundled version for browsers.

2. **Memory errors in browser** - Large graphs may exceed browser memory limits. Consider:
    - Using the memory-efficient preset
    - Processing smaller subgraphs
    - Using Web Workers for parallel processing

3. **Configuration not working** - Ensure configuration is set before importing the library.

## Future Enhancements

- Web Worker support for parallel algorithms
- WASM modules for performance-critical sections
- Streaming APIs for large graph processing
- IndexedDB integration for persistence
