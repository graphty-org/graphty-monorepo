# Decisions waiting for the owner

Changes made locally on the studio branch that add to or change graphty-element's public API. Each
one is a contract with third-party consumers once it is published, so each needs the owner's yes
before it lands on master. Newest first.

## 2026-10-06 -- The force layout's seed default is `null` again (no change from master)

**What.** The studio branch had changed the published default of the default force layout's
`seed` option (`ngraph`, catalog id `force`) from `null` to `1`, and seeded that layout by default
on both of its drivers (the processor and an attached accelerator). That change is undone: the
option's default is `null` again, the default force layout starts from ngraph's own placement, and
the element exports no default-seed constant. The published contract is master's again, so there
is nothing to approve; it is listed because the held pull request that seeded the default (issue
#801) must not land as it stands. The random layout keeps the default seed of `1` it already had on
master.

**Why.** The owner decided on 2026-10-06 that graphty-element imposes no default layout seed: a
consumer that wants the same drawing every load passes a seed. The graphty app does so: it
declares the force layout with seed 1 on the element's tag, so every project starts seeded (as
where the project starts, not an undoable step), and it passes the same seed with every method the
reader picks in the Layout group.

**Alternatives.** Keep the element's default seed (the reverted change; overruled by the owner).
Give the random layout no default seed either (would make the element's own "same every time"
recommendation for large graphs untrue unless a consumer passes a seed; not asked for).

## 2026-10-06 -- `captureScreenshot({ legend })`: a key drawn into the exported image

**What.** `ScreenshotOptions` gains one optional field, `legend?: readonly
ScreenshotLegendSection[]`, and the root entry point exports one new type:

```ts
interface ScreenshotLegendSection {
    title: string;
    rows?: readonly { label: string; color?: string; value?: string }[];
    ramp?: { min: string; max: string; colors?: readonly string[] }; // no colors: a size wedge
    note?: string;
}
```

When the field holds sections, the element draws them as a light card at the image's top left,
sized as it would be on the canvas (it scales with the 2x and 4x sizes), after any supersampling
and before the download or the clipboard write. Absent or empty, nothing changes. Not breaking.

**Why.** An exported picture had no key, so a reader of the report could not tell what the colors
or sizes meant (issue #133). The image is drawn by the element, and the clipboard copy has to be
started from the element's own capture, so only the element can put the key into the file. The
element draws exactly the words it is given: the app builds the sections from the same
`styles.legend()` blocks and the same words as its legend card, and passes them only while the
card is shown, so there is one legend switch and no export-only option.

**Alternatives considered.**

- `legend: true`, with the element writing the section titles itself from `styles.legend()`.
  Simpler for a consumer, but the element would write reader-facing words ("Color: PageRank"),
  which the presentation-neutral rule forbids.
- The app composites its own card onto the returned image. Breaks the clipboard path (the copy
  must start inside the capture to keep the browser's user gesture) and leaves every other
  consumer without a key.
- Accept a rendered image (a canvas or bitmap of the consumer's own legend) and only place it.
  Most flexible, but a consumer must render HTML to a bitmap, which browsers do not offer simply.

**Open points for the owner.** The field and type names; whether the card's place (top left) or
its look (light card, system font) should be options -- today they are fixed.

## 2026-10-06 -- An undirected graph draws its edges without arrowheads

**What.** graphty-element's default edge look now depends on the graph: an edge of a directed graph
draws a `normal` arrowhead as before, and an edge of an undirected graph draws none. A style layer
that sets the arrowhead type still wins either way (a reader can put arrows on an undirected graph,
or take them off a directed one). The exported `defaultEdgeStyle` object no longer carries an
`arrowHead` entry (its type is unchanged), and the `edge.arrowHead` channel descriptor's default is
stated as `"normal"`, the head a directed graph draws. The element's own "Edge defaults" layer no
longer writes the arrowhead type; the renderer adds the head when the graph is directed. Not a type
change; a change to the default picture.

**Why.** Every sample in the app is undirected (marriages, shared chapters, club ties, games) and
was drawn with arrows while the Graph panel said "Undirected". Arrows on a graph whose ties have no
direction invite a wrong reading: asked whether one node can reach another, a reader follows the
arrows and answers "no".

**Alternatives considered.**

- Leave the default and have the app add a "no arrows" layer on undirected graphs. An app
  workaround: every other consumer would still draw arrows on undirected graphs, and the layer
  would sit in the reader's layer list as something they did not add.
- Keep the arrowhead in the element's "Edge defaults" layer and rewrite that layer whenever the
  graph's direction changes. The layer is part of the undo baseline, so undo would bring back the
  old direction's arrows.
- A new arrow type such as `"auto"`. Adds a public enum value that every style editor and every
  saved style would have to understand.

**Open points for the owner.** Whether `explain()` and the layer list should name the arrowhead a
directed graph draws (today they do not list it, since no layer writes it).
