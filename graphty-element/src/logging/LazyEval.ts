/**
 * Lazy evaluation utilities for zero-overhead logging.
 *
 * These helpers allow expensive computations to be deferred until they are
 * actually needed. When logging is disabled or the log level is filtered,
 * the expensive computation is never executed.
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { lazy } from "graphty-element/logging";
 *
 * // Without lazy evaluation - expensive computation always runs
 * logger.debug("Data", { positions: computeExpensivePositions() });
 *
 * // With lazy evaluation - computation only runs if debug is enabled
 * logger.debug("Data", { positions: lazy(() => computeExpensivePositions()) });
 *
 * // Most efficient pattern: combine with level guard
 * if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
 *     logger.debug("Data", { positions: lazy(() => computeExpensivePositions()) });
 * }
 * ```

const LAZY_SYMBOL = Symbol.for("graphty.lazy");

/**

 * The computation result is cached after first evaluation.
 */

    (): T;
    [LAZY_SYMBOL]: true;
}

/**
 * Wrap an expensive computation for lazy evaluation.
 *
 * The provided function will only be called when the lazy value is invoked.
 * After the first call, the result is cached and returned on subsequent calls.
 * @param fn - Function that computes the value
 * @returns A lazy wrapper function that computes and caches the value on first call
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Basic usage
 * const lazyData = lazy(() => computeExpensiveData());
 * logger.debug("Expensive operation", { data: lazyData });
 *
 * // The lazy function can be called manually to get the value
 * const value = lazyData(); // Computes on first call
 * const cachedValue = lazyData(); // Returns cached value
 * ```
 * @remarks
 * **Performance Guidelines:**
 *
 * 1. **Use for expensive computations**: Only wrap computations that are
 *    expensive (serialization, large object traversal, etc.)
 *
 * 2. **Combine with level guards**: For maximum efficiency, use `isDebugEnabled()`
 *    or `isTraceEnabled()` guards to avoid even creating the lazy wrapper:
 *    ```typescript
 *    if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
 *        logger.debug("Data", { complex: lazy(() => serialize(node)) });
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 * 3. **Avoid in hot paths**: Even the lazy wrapper creation has some overhead.
 *    In render loops or per-frame callbacks, use level guards without lazy.
