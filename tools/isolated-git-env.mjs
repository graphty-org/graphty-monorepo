/**
 * The environment every test that runs git -- directly, or through a script or a CLI under test --
 * must give it. Without it git reads the developer's own ~/.gitconfig: with commit.gpgsign=true
 * there, a test's throwaway `git commit` asks gpg-agent for a passphrase on the owner's terminal
 * in the middle of the pre-push gate. tools/ci-workflows.test.mjs fails if a test file runs git
 * without importing this.
 *
 * The global config is a temporary file holding only an identity, not /dev/null, so a commit works
 * without one. Signing stays at git's default, off, because nothing sets it; a test that turns
 * signing on in its own repository (the visual-review accept and serve tests do) still can, which a
 * command-line override would prevent. The system config is skipped. Only the
 * variables a git hook exports are dropped (GIT_DIR and friends point git at the real repository
 * even from a temporary directory); every other GIT_* variable, such as a GIT_CONFIG_COUNT
 * override the caller's environment sets, is kept.
